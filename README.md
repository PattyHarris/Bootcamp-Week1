# Setting up Tailwind

There's a number of tutorials on setting up tailwind.  They all pretty much suck.
I needed to install the following:
```
npm install -D tailwindcss
npm install postcss-cli autoprefixer
```

One of the tutorials used live-server, but I couldn't get that to work?  But I did install it:
```
npm install -g live-server
```

Also tried to get 'watch' to work, so the package.json has this as a script.  To install:
```
npm install watch
```

To run the script:
```
npm run watch
```
